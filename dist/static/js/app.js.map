luxcentral.com]\n * @fileoverview MarkerWithLabel extends the Google Maps JavaScript API V3\n *  <code>google.maps.Marker</code> class.\n *  <p>\n *  MarkerWithLabel allows you to define markers with associated labels. As you would expect,\n *  if the marker is draggable, so too will be the label. In addition, a marker with a label\n *  responds to all mouse events in the same manner as a regular marker. It also fires mouse\n *  events and \"property changed\" events just as a regular marker would. Version 1.1 adds\n *  support for the raiseOnDrag feature introduced in API V3.3.\n *  <p>\n *  If you drag a marker by its label, you can cancel the drag and return the marker to its\n *  original position by pressing the <code>Esc</code> key. This doesn't work if you drag the marker\n *  itself because this feature is not (yet) supported in the <code>google.maps.Marker</code> class.\n */\n\n/*!\n *\n * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n * You may obtain a copy of the License at\n *\n *       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n *\n * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n * distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n * limitations under the License.\n */\n\n/* jslint browser:true */\n/* global document,google */\n\n/**\n * @param {Function} childCtor Child class.\n * @param {Function} parentCtor Parent class.\n */\nfunction inherits(childCtor, parentCtor) {\n  /** @constructor */\n  function tempCtor() { };\n  tempCtor.prototype = parentCtor.prototype\n  childCtor.superClass_ = parentCtor.prototype\n  childCtor.prototype = new tempCtor()\n  /** @override */\n  childCtor.prototype.constructor = childCtor\n}\n\n/**\n * @param {Object} gMapsApi The Google Maps API instance (usually `google.maps`)\n * @return {Function} The instantiable MarkerWithLabel class\n */\nmodule.exports = function (gMapsApi) {\n  /**\n     * This constructor creates a label and associates it with a marker.\n     * It is for the private use of the MarkerWithLabel class.\n     * @constructor\n     * @param {Marker} marker The marker with which the label is to be associated.\n     * @param {string} crossURL The URL of the cross image =.\n     * @param {string} handCursor The URL of the hand cursor.\n     * @private\n     */\n  function MarkerLabel_(marker, crossURL, handCursorURL) {\n    this.marker_ = marker\n    this.handCursorURL_ = marker.handCursorURL\n\n    this.labelDiv_ = document.createElement('div')\n    this.labelDiv_.style.cssText = 'position: absolute; overflow: hidden;'\n\n    // Set up the DIV for handling mouse events in the label.
